# Local RAG Chat

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat application that allows users to interact with a local knowledge base using natural language queries.

This is a tutorial project to learn about RAG, vector databases, and large language models (LLMs).

## Objectives

1. Parse PDF documents and extract text. Save text to a vector database.
2. Use a local LLM to answer questions based on the text in the vector database.
3. Apply row-level security (RLS) to the vector database to restrict access to documents based on users.
4. Allow users to converse with the system, asking questions and receiving answers based on the documents they have access to.
5. Create a Python CLI program to demonstrate functionality.
